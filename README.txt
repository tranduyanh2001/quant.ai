# quant.ai

Hi, this is Quant.AI done by Duy Anh, Vignesh and Phone

Order to run the files is:
1. requirements.txt
2. nltk_utils.py
3. model.py
4. train.py
5. chat.py

Once you run chat.py, you will be prompted to input the 4 letter ticker. Please only input the 4 letter ticker and click enter.
You can then text to Quant.AI as per normal.

This version runs on Windows for the text to speech feature whereby Quant.AI will respond using audio as well.
Please close the VLC player in Windows to move to the next command.

We used the tutorial by Python Engineer : Chatbot with Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing Playlist to understand
and form the base of our code. Special thanks to him!
